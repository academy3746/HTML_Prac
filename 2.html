		Sing me a song, you're a singer<br>
		Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil<br>
		The devil is never a maker<br>
		The less that you give, you're a taker<br>
		So it's on and on and on, it's Heaven and Hell<br>
		Oh well
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		The lover of life's not a sinner<br>
		The ending is just a beginner<br>
		The closer you get to the meaning<br>
		The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming<br>
		So it's on and on and on, oh, it's on and on and on<br>
		It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell<br>
		I can tell<br>
		Fool, fool
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		Oh, ooh<br>
		Yeah, yeah, yeah
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		Well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion<br>
		For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life<br>
		Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer<br>
		And it's on and on<br>
		On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		They say that life's a carousel<br>
		Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well<br>
		The world is full of kings and queens<br>
		Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams<br>
		It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		And they'll tell you black is really white<br>
		The moon is just the sun at night<br>
		And when you walk in golden halls<br>
		You get to keep the gold that falls<br>
		It's Heaven and Hell, oh no
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		Fool, fool<br>
		You've got to bleed for the dancer<br>
		Fool, fool<br>
		Look for the answer<br>
		Fool, fool, fool
