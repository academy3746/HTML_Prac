		There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold<br>
		And she's buying a stairway to heaven<br>
		When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed<br>
		With a word she can get what she came for<br>
		Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure<br>
		'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings<br>
		In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings<br>
		Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven<br>
		You know
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		There's a feeling I get when I look to the west<br>
		And my spirit is crying for leaving<br>
		In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees<br>
		And the voices of those who stand looking<br>
		That's you
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune<br>
		Then the piper will lead us to reason<br>
		And a new day will dawn for those who stand long<br>
		And the forests will echo with laughter<br>
		Remember laughter?
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		And it makes me wonder<br>
		If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now<br>
		It's just a spring clean for the May queen<br>
		Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br>
		There's still time to change the road you're on
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know<br>
		The piper's calling you to join him<br>
		Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know<br>
		Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		And as we wind on down the road<br>
		Our shadows taller than our soul<br>
		There walks a lady we all know<br>
		Who shines white light and wants to show<br>
		How everything still turns to gold
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		And if you listen very hard<br>
		The tune will come to you at last<br>
		When all is one and one is all, that's what it is<br>
		To be a rock and not to roll, oh yeah
	</p>
	<p style = "margin-top:15px;">
		And she's buying a stairway to heaven
