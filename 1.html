		Finished with my woman 'cause<br>
		She couldn't help me with my mind<br>
		People think I'm insane because<br>
		I am frowning all the time
	</p>

	<p style = "margin-top:20px;">
		All day long I think of things<br>
		But nothing seems to satisfy<br>
		Think I'll lose my mind<br>
		If I don't find something to pacify
	</p>

	<p style = "margin-top:20px;">
		Can you help me<br>
		Occupy my brain?<br>
		Oh yeah
	</p>

	<p style = "margin-top:20px;">
		I need someone to show me<br>
		The things in life that I can't find<br>
		I can't see the things that make<br>
		True happiness, I must be blind
	</p>

	<p style = "margin-top:20px;">
		Make a joke and I will sigh<br>
		And you will laugh and I will cry<br>
		Happiness I cannot feel<br>
		And love to me is so unreal
	</p>

	<p style = "margin-top:20px;">
		And so as you hear these words<br>
		Telling you now of my state<br>
		I tell you to enjoy life<br>
		I wish I could but it's too late
